- Kratos Task -

Hello, my friend who loves coding. We have prepared a task for you to work with us, improve yourself, and hopefully learn from you. Below, we will explain in detail what we want you to do in this simple task:






Task Overview:
You need to design a total of 4 pages. The UI designs of the pages are as follows:

Launch Page:
You have to place the GIF we provided on the app's startup for 5 seconds, after which you should automatically be redirected to the Login Page.
Points: 10

Login Page:
The page should have a functional "Login" button and a "Create One" button.
Login Button           → redirects to the Home Page
Create One Button → redirects to the Create Account Page
Points: 10

Create Account Page:
In addition to the UI design, the page should have functional "Create Account" and "Cancel" buttons.
Cancel Button                → redirects to the Login Page
Create Account Button → redirects to the Home Page
Points: 10

Home Page:
The page should display only the username in the center and a functional "Logout" button that returns to the Login Page.
Logout Button → redirects to the Login Page
Points: 5








Things to Watch Out For:
We want you to use Flutter or SwiftUI for coding your Mobile App (You can also use UIKit if you prefer).
The app should be compatible with different screen sizes when it opens.
You have to share your project with us on your GitHub Account.
Points: 15


Bonus Points:
Implementing authentication, including login and logout functionality via email using Firebase.
Points: 30
Ensuring clean coding practices, proper folder structure, and necessary comment lines in your project (you can use any design pattern you prefer).
Points: 20


Good luck! We look forward to seeing your project.
